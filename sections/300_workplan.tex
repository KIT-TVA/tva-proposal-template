\section*{Workplan}
\label{sec:workplan}

\hint{In this section you will define work packages for your thesis and define a time schedule to work on them.
Start by thinking about which tasks you need to perform to answer your research questions from the introduction.
Define headlines for your tasks, split bigger tasks into sub-tasks and think about how critical those sub-tasks are for the success of your thesis (must, should, can) 
Then describe in detail, what you have to do, in those tasks and sub-tasks.
After you have your work packages defined, make a time table to structure your work over the time of your thesis.
Remember to allocate time for writing the thesis and work with a buffer in case of unforeseen events.
Visualize your time schedule.}
